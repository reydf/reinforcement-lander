# Reinforcement Learning Study using OpenAI Lunar Lander
Personal Study of Various RL algorithm on the OpenAI Lunar Lander module using PyTorch.

Largely under construction.

To run, download the .py files and run main.py. For the Jupyter Notebook files, you can use Colab.

To be added next: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation for the Lunar Lander.
